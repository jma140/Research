    "**Time series** differ from other sources of data in that they are explicitly ordered.  The usual intent is to use past data to make predictions about the future, so only data from the past may be used to make a prediction.  For simplicity, we will ignore this restriction for most of these sessions, but will discuss it in the context of **online learning** towards the end.\n",

By this, we mean that the anomalous data is not **labeled**.  We must detect it by learning what the normal data look like."
